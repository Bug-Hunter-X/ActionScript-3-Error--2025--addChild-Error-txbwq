This repository contains a demonstration of ActionScript 3 Error #2025: The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller, along with its solution. The error typically occurs when addChild is used on a DisplayObject that's not yet in the display list hierarchy.  The solution involves ensuring the DisplayObject is added to the display list only after it's fully loaded and initialized.
